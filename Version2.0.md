**Scaling Up**

-   three significant modifications
-   new name for your game and change the UI in the game to reflect the new name
-   making sure there are no bugs (code issues), flaws in gameplay, or look-and-feel issues
-   on Itch.io : or Windows and Mac builds, make sure to select "Executable" and select the corresponding platform. For WebGL, make sure to click "This file will be played in the browser". Include a description of your actual modifications to the game (at least 3) AND your game credits ("Created by ...").
